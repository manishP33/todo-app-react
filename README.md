# React Todo App

Today's objective is to apply the fundamentals of what we learned so far by building a Todo app in React.

Why build a todo app?

Because it is the prototypical CRUD app that will test your web development skills with a different technology in a familiar domain.

## User Stories

Ultimately, it is up to you how your application should function but the app should meet the specs for the following user stories:

**Bronze**
* As a user, I should be able to see all my incomplete todos
* As a user, I should be able to add a new todo to the list
* As a user, I should be able to mark a todo as completed
* As a user, I should able to edit a todo's content
* As a user, I should be able to delete a todo

**Silver**
* As a user, I should be able to also see a list of my completed todos
* As a user, when I mark a todo as complete, it should be added to my completed todos list
* As a user, when I mark a completed todo as incomplete, it should be added to my todos list

**Gold**
* As a user, I should be able to make a new list
* As a user, I should be able to edit a list
* As a user, I should be able to delete a list.

**Platinum**
* As a user, when I refresh the page, I should be able to have my application's state be persisted
* As a user, I should be able to drag and drop todo items between lists.
